### Introduction



**Summa Theologica**, IaIIae, q. 26, a. 4:

> "Madness is a defect of reason, arising from a corrupt disposition of the irascible or concupiscible faculty. Now the irascible and concupiscible faculties are naturally subject to reason; and therefore, if they are inordinately moved, they will hinder the use of reason. Hence it is that madness is a kind of privation of reason."

In this passage, Aquinas defines madness as a defect of reason that arises from a corrupt disposition of the irascible or concupiscible faculties. These faculties are naturally subject to reason, but if they are inordinately moved, they will hinder the use of reason. This can lead to a variety of mental illnesses, including delusions, hallucinations, and impaired judgment.

Aquinas's view of madness is based on his understanding of the human person as a rational being. He believes that reason is the highest faculty of the soul, and that it is essential for human flourishing. When reason is impaired, it can lead to a variety of problems, including mental illness.

Aquinas's view of madness is still relevant today. It reminds us that mental illness is a real medical condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including physical and psychological problems. It also reminds us that the human person is a whole being, and that both spiritual and medical treatment can be helpful for people with mental illness.

### Cï»¿atholicism and Psychiatry

The Catholic faith has a long history of engagement with mental health issues. In the early days of the Church, mental illness was often seen as a sign of demonic possession. However, over time, the Church came to recognize that mental illness is a real medical condition that can be treated.

Today, the Catholic Church supports the use of modern psychiatry to treat mental illness. The Church teaches that mental illness is a disorder of the soul as well as the body, and that both spiritual and medical treatment can be helpful.

There are a number of ways in which the Catholic faith can complement modern psychiatry. For example, the Church's emphasis on prayer, forgiveness, and reconciliation can help to promote healing and wholeness. Additionally, the Church's teachings on the meaning and purpose of human life can provide a framework for understanding mental illness and its treatment.

* The Catholic Church has a long history of founding and operating hospitals and other healthcare institutions. Many of these institutions have specialized in the treatment of mental illness.
* The Catholic Church has also produced a number of influential figures in the field of psychiatry, including Saint John of God, Saint Vincent de Paul, and Mother Teresa.
* The Catholic faith emphasizes the importance of the human person as a whole, body and soul. This holistic approach to human nature can be a valuable asset in the treatment of mental illness.
* The Catholic faith also teaches the importance of community and social support. This can be especially important for people with mental illness, who often feel isolated and alone.

The Catholic faith and modern psychiatry can work together to provide comprehensive care for people with mental illness. By combining the best of both worlds, we can help people to heal and flourish in body, mind, and soul.
