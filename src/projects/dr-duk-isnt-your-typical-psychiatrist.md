Dr. Duk isn't your typical psychiatrist. He's attentive, listens to your issues, provides useful information & is willing to go out of his way to make sure you are doing well. He was out sick when I was experiencing a difficult time and when medication had ran out and he still made sure to contact me personally to assess the nature of my predicament, & promptly offered a viable solution. He provides encouragement and practical methods to excel rather than simply depending on medications alone.
