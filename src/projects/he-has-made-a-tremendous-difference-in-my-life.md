I have traveled over 60 miles each way--from the desert to Redlands for the past 4 years to be treated at IPMG. Although there are many medical groups located in the desert, none has compared to the professionalism and progress I have received at IPMG. I would like to put a spotlight on Dr. Anthony Duk. I have been seen by several therapists and none has compared to Dr. Duk. I have been his patient for the past 4 years. He not only communicates well verbally but has an understanding of the problems confronted by patients who are, struggling with psychological issues. Dr. Duk uses a variety of counseling methods based on each person’s specific background and behavioral issues. With each one he takes into account and respects individual differences, experiences, and values; provides realistic goals; encourages the patients in appropriate self-expression and communicates a genuine interest and concern for each patient. He has made a tremendous difference in my life.
