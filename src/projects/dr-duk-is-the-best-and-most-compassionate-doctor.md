I've been seeing Dr. Duk for several years now and he is by far the best doctor out there. I don't usually post but after seeing some reviews, I just had too. It is sad how evil people can be when they don't get what they want. He does not prescribe narcotics just because someone wants them; his integrity is to important to him and I appreciate someone with good morals because shows how much he cares for his patients. Instead of trying to tear him down, you should leave and go elsewhere. He is always willing to help you and he doesn't care about the time; he cares about the person. I need this in my doctor and I TRUST Dr. Duk with my life. It's true that IPM has a big turnover in office staff so it can be difficult to get in but you have to keep calling because seeing Dr. Duk is worth it. And, he is not responsible for the receptionist, his boss is so don't take it out on him.
