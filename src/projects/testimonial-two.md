Dr. Anthony Duk is an excellent psychiatrist. From the moment my mother and I met Dr. Duk, we could tell he truly cares about his patients. My mother is extremely sensitive and felt comfortable with Dr. Duk. He creates a safe and non-judgmental environment. I appreciate his ability to make his patients feel comfortable and at ease. He is always understanding and takes his time to listen to our concerns and needs. I highly recommend Dr. Duk to anyone seeking psychiatric care. He is a wonderful doctor who truly cares about helping his patients achieve their best mental health. My mother's misdiagnoses in the past led to many unnecessary treatments and procedures. For many years I felt as if my mother was no longer here and I had to stop my life from a very young age to care for her. Words can't express how thankful I am for Dr. Duk. I can't thank him enough for properly diagnosing my mother. Not only did he make a difference in my mother's life, but also made a difference in mine.
