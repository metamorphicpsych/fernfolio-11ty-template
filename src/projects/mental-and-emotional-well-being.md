I have been seeing Dr. Duk for several years and his constant positive reinforcement has helped me very much over this time. He asks his patients to take more responsibility over their lives and to make daily steps to improve their mental and emotional well being. Because of this encouragement, I was gradually able to get over my depression and take on new challenges. His appointments are very short but he takes careful notes and doesn’t waste your time.
