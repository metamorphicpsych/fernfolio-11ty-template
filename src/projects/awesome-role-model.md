I moved away from the area but Dr. Duk is still my psychiatrist. COVID has allowed for telephone sessions so he is still my psych even though I am away in college and out of state. Awesome role model human being. I really like his real and personal advice. He is genuine. We discuss things a bit, since he does emails really well, but I get him.
