I have 2 kids with special needs and some child abuse issues of my own growing up and I really enjoy talking with him. He is a warm and generous psychiatrist (unlike some of the county ones I have before) who really talks a lot more than other MDs. He integrates my Catholic spirituality and morality topics well and shows how to help my kids with their own developmental issues and how to handle all the craziness. I've been juggling going back to college, handling online COVID school issues with the kids and full time mommy duties with the house and husband....... his counsel is awesome. BUT, he really is not one to take excuses (I've tried) and i appreciate him calling me on my lack of effort when I don't push myself. That makes him real and awesome."
