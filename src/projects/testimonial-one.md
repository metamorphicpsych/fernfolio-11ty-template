My son has Autism spectrum. And has been Dr. Duk for over 9 years. Before I met Dr.Duk, my son tried several medications, but was not successful. But after Dr. Duk’s Appropriate prescription and treatment he improved a lot and stable condition. Also. He's always quick to reach me, even when I'm in a hurry, so I'm so grateful and thankful. He is real Dr.
