Dr. Duk saved my life. When I was severely depressed he saw me immediately, when my primary physician wouldn’t see me for 3weeks. He has been innovative in prescribing medication for a resilient depression I have suffered on and off for my entire adult life. He has been supportive and also made me try things I am resistant to. When my son became depressed he saw my son immediately even though he was no longer taking new patients. My son is doing fine now. I trust Dr. Duk and appreciate him.
