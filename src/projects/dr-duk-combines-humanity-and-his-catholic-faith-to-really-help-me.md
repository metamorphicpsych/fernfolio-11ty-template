(My son is writing this for me; my arthritis is bad). We are from Pakistan and my wife and I came her many years ago. She has schizophrenia. It was a nightmare. We have seen so many psychs and this doctor is the best. He has patiently reassured me and helped her with labs and stabilizing her meds. My wife is very sick and may never get much better --- most of the time she drinks lots of soda and claims animals are in the kitchen. It is tough to keep her from smoking so much. But dr Duk combines humanity and his Catholic faith to really help me. I really like that. I wish we had more people that cared like him. He is like a son to me and our family really appreciates him.
