  "description": "As an adult psychiatrist for nearly 20 years, I help empower patients to find meaning and coach them on changing their lifestyles. Medication, reading self help books, exercising, journaling and social interactions are all vital to changing for the better. I rely on background with the Catholic faith to help people become fully who God intended them to be."
