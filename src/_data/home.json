Medication, reading self help books, exercising, journaling and social interactions are all vital to changing for the better. I rely on my background with the Catholic faith to help people become fully who God intended them to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n> *\"﻿Every man dies, but not every man lives.\"* \\\n> —Sir William Wallace\n\n\n\n###### A﻿ddress\n\n1﻿9510 Van Buren Blvd\\\nSte F3, PMB 261\\\nRiverside, CA 92508\n\n###### O﻿ffice Hours\n\nMonday 3:00pm – 5:00pm\\\nFriday 3:00pm – 5:00pm\n\n###### P﻿hone\n\n(﻿909) 588-9275"
